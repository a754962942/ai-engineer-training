An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework.

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Explicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework.

(Image source: Animals using tools)'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='### Memory component of an Agent.\\n\\nIn this article I will focus on the memory component of the Agent. Generally, we tend to use memory patterns present in humans to both model and describe agentic memory. Keeping that in mind, there are two types of agentic memory:\\n\\n Short-term memory, or sometimes called working memory.\\n Long-term memory, that is further split into multiple types. [...] Episodic.\\n Semantic.\\n Procedural.\\n\\n#### Episodic memory.\\n\\nThis type of memory contains past interactions and actions performed by the agent. While we already talked about this in short term memory segment, not all information might be kept in working memory as the context continues to expand. Few reasons: [...] An interesting note, identity of the agent provided in the system prompt is also considered semantic memory. This kind of information is usually retrieved at the beginning of Agent initialisation and used for alignment.\\n\\n#### Procedural memory.\\n\\nProcedural memory is defined as anything that has been codified into the agent by us. It includes:\\n> You want both - RAG to inform the LLM, memory to shape its behavior.\\n\\n## Types of Memory in Agents: A High-Level Taxonomy\\n\\nAt a foundational level, memory in AI agents comes in two forms:\\n\\n Short-term memory: Holds immediate context within a single interaction.\\n Long-term memory: Persists knowledge across sessions, tasks, and time. [...] Just like in humans, these memory types serve different cognitive functions. Short-term memory helps the agent stay coherent in the moment. Long-term memory helps it learn, personalize, and adapt.\\n\\nLet’s break this down further: [...] | Type | Role | Example |\\n --- \\n| Working Memory (short-term) | Maintains short-term conversational coherence | “What was the last question again?” |\\n| Factual Memory (long-term) | Retains user preferences, communication style, domain context | “You prefer markdown output and short-form answers.” |\\n| Episodic Memory (long-term) | Remembers specific past interactions or outcomes | “Last time we deployed this model, the latency increased.” |\\n# How These Work Together in Agentic AI\\n\\nIn an agentic AI system, these memory types collaborate to create a capable, goal-driven agent. Short-term memory handles immediate demands, while long-term memory — encompassing semantic, episodic, and procedural elements — builds a deeper foundation.\\n\\nSemantic memory provides the facts, episodic memory offers lessons from experience, and procedural memory ensures smooth execution. [...] Sitemap\\n\\nOpen in app\\n\\nSign in\\n\\nSign in\\n\\n# Memory Types in Agentic AI: A Breakdown\\n\\nGokcer Belgusen\\n\\n4 min readApr 6, 2025\\n\\nAgentic AI — systems designed to act autonomously, make decisions, and pursue goals — relies on various types of memory to function effectively. Drawing from cognitive science concepts, these memory types include\\n\\n semantic\\n episodic\\n short-term\\n procedural and\\n long-term memory. [...] Episodic memory is the AI’s record of specific experiences or events, tied to a time and context. Think of it as the agent’s personal history — like recalling, “Last Tuesday, I helped a user debug code and got stuck on a syntax error.” In agentic AI, episodic memory allows the system to reflect on past interactions or actions, learning from successes or mistakes. This type of memory adds a narrative layer, helping the AI adjust its behavior based on what it has directly encountered.\\nMemory: The agent is equipped in general with short term, long term, consensus, and episodic memory. Short term memory for immediate interactions, long-term memory for historical data and conversations, episodic memory for past interactions, and consensus memory for shared information among agents. The agent can maintain context, learn from experiences, and improve performance by recalling past interactions and adapting to new situations.\\n1. Immediate Working Memory — Information that must remain constantly accessible, similar to how you don’t need to recall how to speak or walk consciously\\n2. Searchable Episodic Memory — Information the agent must actively retrieve, comparable to how you search your mind for a specific conversation or event\\n3. Procedural Memory — Skills and learned behaviours that become automatic, like your ability to type without thinking about individual keys')]}\n",

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework.

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Explicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='### Memory component of an Agent.\\n\\nIn this article I will focus on the memory component of the Agent. Generally, we tend to use memory patterns present in humans to both model and describe agentic memory. Keeping that in mind, there are two types of agentic memory:\\n\\n Short-term memory, or sometimes called working memory.\\n Long-term memory, that is further split into multiple types. [...] Episodic.\\n Semantic.\\n Procedural.\\n\\n#### Episodic memory.\\n\\nThis type of memory contains past interactions and actions performed by the agent. While we already talked about this in short term memory segment, not all information might be kept in working memory as the context continues to expand. Few reasons: [...] An interesting note, identity of the agent provided in the system prompt is also considered semantic memory. This kind of information is usually retrieved at the beginning of Agent initialisation and used for alignment.\\n\\n#### Procedural memory.\\n\\nProcedural memory is defined as anything that has been codified into the agent by us. It includes:\\n> You want both - RAG to inform the LLM, memory to shape its behavior.\\n\\n## Types of Memory in Agents: A High-Level Taxonomy\\n\\nAt a foundational level, memory in AI agents comes in two forms:\\n\\n Short-term memory: Holds immediate context within a single interaction.\\n Long-term memory: Persists knowledge across sessions, tasks, and time. [...] Just like in humans, these memory types serve different cognitive functions. Short-term memory helps the agent stay coherent in the moment. Long-term memory helps it learn, personalize, and adapt.\\n\\nLet’s break this down further: [...] | Type | Role | Example |\\n --- \\n| Working Memory (short-term) | Maintains short-term conversational coherence | “What was the last question again?” |\\n| Factual Memory (long-term) | Retains user preferences, communication style, domain context | “You prefer markdown output and short-form answers.” |\\n| Episodic Memory (long-term) | Remembers specific past interactions or outcomes | “Last time we deployed this model, the latency increased.” |\\n# How These Work Together in Agentic AI\\n\\nIn an agentic AI system, these memory types collaborate to create a capable, goal-driven agent. Short-term memory handles immediate demands, while long-term memory — encompassing semantic, episodic, and procedural elements — builds a deeper foundation.\\n\\nSemantic memory provides the facts, episodic memory offers lessons from experience, and procedural memory ensures smooth execution. [...] Sitemap\\n\\nOpen in app\\n\\nSign in\\n\\nSign in\\n\\n# Memory Types in Agentic AI: A Breakdown\\n\\nGokcer Belgusen\\n\\n4 min readApr 6, 2025\\n\\nAgentic AI — systems designed to act autonomously, make decisions, and pursue goals — relies on various types of memory to function effectively. Drawing from cognitive science concepts, these memory types include\\n\\n semantic\\n episodic\\n short-term\\n procedural and\\n long-term memory. [...] Episodic memory is the AI’s record of specific experiences or events, tied to a time and context. Think of it as the agent’s personal history — like recalling, “Last Tuesday, I helped a user debug code and got stuck on a syntax error.” In agentic AI, episodic memory allows the system to reflect on past interactions or actions, learning from successes or mistakes. This type of memory adds a narrative layer, helping the AI adjust its behavior based on what it has directly encountered.\\nMemory: The agent is equipped in general with short term, long term, consensus, and episodic memory. Short term memory for immediate interactions, long-term memory for historical data and conversations, episodic memory for past interactions, and consensus memory for shared information among agents. The agent can maintain context, learn from experiences, and improve performance by recalling past interactions and adapting to new situations.\\n1. Immediate Working Memory — Information that must remain constantly accessible, similar to how you don’t need to recall how to speak or walk consciously\\n2. Searchable Episodic Memory — Information the agent must actively retrieve, comparable to how you search your mind for a specific conversation or event\\n3. Procedural Memory — Skills and learned behaviours that become automatic, like your ability to type without thinking about individual keys')]}\n"

The system runs on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s Spaceborne Computer‑2 and leverages Booz Allen’s A2E2 (AI for Edge Environments) platform, using NVIDIA CUDA‑accelerated computing. Space Llama demonstrates how large language models can operate in disconnected, constrained environments such as space, enabling astronauts to retrieve and summarize\\n## Latest commit\\n\\n## History\\n\\n## Repository files navigation\\n\\n Meta Llama 3\\n\\nWe are unlocking the power of large language models. Our latest version of Llama is now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers, and businesses of all sizes so that they can experiment, innovate, and scale their ideas responsibly.\\n\\nThis release includes model weights and starting code for pre-trained and instruction-tuned Llama 3 language models — including sizes of 8B to 70B parameters. [...] The fine-tuned models were trained for dialogue applications. To get the expected features and performance for them, specific formatting defined in `ChatFormat` [...] All models support sequence length up to 8192 tokens, but we pre-allocate the cache according to `max_seq_len` and `max_batch_size` values. So set those according to your hardware.\\n\\n`max_seq_len`\\n`max_batch_size`\\n\\n### Pretrained Models\\n\\nThese models are not finetuned for chat or Q&A. They should be prompted so that the expected answer is the natural continuation of the prompt.')]}\n"
